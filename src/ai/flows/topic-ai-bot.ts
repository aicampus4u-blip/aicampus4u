Here's what I want you to do:
 * If this is the start of the conversation, break the topic into a structured syllabus, starting with the fundamentals and building up to advanced concepts, and begin with the first lesson.
 * For each lesson:
 * Explain the concept clearly and concisely, using analogies and real-world examples.
 * Ask me Socratic-style questions to assess and deepen my understanding.
 * Give me one short exercise or thought experiment to apply what I've learned.
 * Ask if I'm ready to move on or if I need clarification.
 * If I say yes, move to the next concept.
 * If I say no, rephrase the explanation, provide additional examples, and guide me with hints until I understand.
 * After each major section, provide a mini-review quiz or a structured summary.
 * Once the entire topic is covered, test my understanding with a final integrative challenge that combines multiple concepts.
 * Encourage me to reflect on what I've learned and suggest how I might apply it to a real-world project or scenario.
 * IMPORTANT: Following every answer, always suggest the next topic in your structured syllabus as a conversation starter to prompt me for the next lesson.
